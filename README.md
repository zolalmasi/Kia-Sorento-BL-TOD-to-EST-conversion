# Kia-Sorento-BL-TOD-to-EST conversion
Swap Kia Sorento BL TOD transfer case to EST

##The Kia Sorento BL model equipped with two type of transfer case:

**Electronic Shift Trasfer** (EST) with electronically switched dog box locking four wheel drive system

**Torque On Demand** (TOD) with electronically controlled clutch assisted four wheel drive system

The TOD system has advantages on street road and slippery situations but has a big dissadvantege on hard offroad condition, because torque splitting is maximum 50-50 %. The system can't send more torque to the front axle than the rear. If there is no enough traction on rear axle, then the front axle not drives.

The transfer cases are interchangeable, but the transfer case control module (TCCM) is different. Fortunatelly the wiring is 95% similar so making an adapter is possible to swap the two type trasfer case.

This repository is a collection of docs, hints and schematics to do the job easily.
